# Information
:sunglasses: :sunglasses: :sunglasses: *Good morning and happy day to the Github community, with great excitement I can tell you that here is my first successful socket application that I created in Node.JS. It's a great web app and it's like a pharmacy where I live. The customer enters the pharmacy. take a ticket (N Â° 95) and wait in line for your turn, the pharmacists attend to the people and one by one you approach your turn.*:sunglasses: :sunglasses: :sunglasses:

*It is a web application that represents the line in any store* :octocat:
